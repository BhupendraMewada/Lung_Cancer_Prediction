# Lung Cancer Detection System

## Project Overview

The Lung Cancer Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the likelihood of lung cancer from medical imaging data. This project utilizes two different models:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: For image-based detection using CT scans.
2. **Random Forest**: For symptom-based prediction using patient-reported symptoms.

The system integrates both models to provide a comprehensive solution for early lung cancer detection.

## Features

- **CT Scan Image Analysis**: Use CNN to analyze lung CT scan images and classify them into categories (e.g., "Lung cancer detected" or "No lung cancer detected").
- **Symptom-Based Prediction**: Use a Random Forest model to predict lung cancer risk based on patient-reported symptoms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the models and get predictions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
